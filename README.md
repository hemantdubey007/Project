Features to Explore:
Modular Design: Independently crafted Navbar and Footer modules for enhanced modularity and reusability.
Dynamic Integration Magic: Witness the dynamic integration of these modules into multiple pages using the JavaScript Fetch API.
Responsive Design: Responsiveness of all pages, ensuring a seamless experience across devices of all shapes and sizes.
Tech Note: Please note a slight delay during the loading of components, a small quirk resulting from the asynchronous nature of Fetch.
Getting Started:
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the index.html file in the root directory and open it.
Open the index.html file in the browser
You'll initially see a "Project" link â€“ clicking this link will reveal our Apollo Pharmacy UI clone.
Alternatively, to go directly to the home page without clicking the "Project" link, open the folder named Monal_Hemant and then open the home.html file in your browser.
Feel free to explore the UI clone using either method. Due to the organization of our project, each team member's contribution is housed in a separate folder named after them.
